# Live Demo: https://liftedlogic.vercel.app/


## Instructions:

1. Use the font Karla (available on Google Fonts https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla)
2. The navigation bar should always stick to the top of the page.
3. The background image on the hero banner should have an animation of slowly zooming in and back out.
4. The image to the left of the “Brent Faiyaz, So Far Gone” content should automatically match the height of the content section to the right of it. Try to avoid setting a fixed height in CSS.
5. Buttons should have animations on hover state.
6. “New Releases” section should be a slider with each card (image, title, name, and short paragraph) being a slide.
7. “New Releases” slider should be navigable with the arrows.
8. Bonus: Include a full width google map in the page with a custom skin. Add a pin for Lifted Logic’s location, 10261 W 87th St, Overland Park, KS 66212

## Do’s and Dont's 

1. Please do not use a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap, Foundation, etc.)
2. Please use the InvisionApp link and provided design documents to help figure out how to style the page.
3. Use of javascript libraries to assist with functionality is okay (e.g. Slick Carousel, Magnific popup, jQuery )
4. The layout should be responsive. You can be creative and use your best judgment when determining the layout as the screen size becomes smaller.
5. Forms do not need to validate or submit. But client-side validation is cool.
